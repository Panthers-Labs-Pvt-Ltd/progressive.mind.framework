# Completeness

Completeness measures how much of the required data is present in a dataset. Complete data contains all the necessary information and is not missing any values. In mathematical terms, completeness is the ratio of the number of non-missing values to the total number of values in a dataset, or alternatively, $1-\frac{number\ of\ missing\ values}{total\ number\ of\ values}$ in a dataset.

Completeness can be measured using metrics such as 
* the percentage of missing values
* the percentage of complete records
* and the percentage of complete columns.

Completeness can be assessed at the level of individual records, columns, or datasets. //TODO: Manage scoring (missing value rate, completeness score) at each level.

We can use the following methods to assess the completeness of data:

1. **Check for missing values**: Check for missing values in the dataset using functions such as `isnull()`, `isna()`, `notnull()`, and `notna()` in Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
2. **Calculate the percentage of missing values**: Calculate the percentage of missing values in each column or record to assess the completeness of the data.
3. **Impute missing values**: Impute missing values using methods such as mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation, or predictive imputation to fill in missing values and make the data more complete.
4. **Drop missing values**: Drop records or columns with missing values if they cannot be imputed or if they are not relevant to the analysis.
5. **Check for completeness of records**: Check if each record in the dataset contains all the required fields and information.
6. **Check for completeness of columns**: Check if each column in the dataset contains all the required values and information.
7. **Visualize missing values**: Visualize missing values using heatmaps, bar charts, or other visualization techniques to identify patterns of missingness and assess the completeness of the data.
8. **Compare completeness across datasets**: Compare the completeness of different datasets to identify missing values and assess data quality.
9. **Define completeness thresholds**: Define thresholds for completeness metrics such as the percentage of missing values, complete records, or complete columns to set standards for data quality.

We can also use Data Quality tools such as Great Expectations, TensorFlow Data Validation, and AWS Deeque to automate the assessment of data completeness and monitor data quality over time.

## Using Great Expectations for Data Completeness

// TODO: Add more details about Great Expectations

Great Expectations is an open-source Python library that helps you define, manage, and validate data expectations. You can use Great Expectations to define expectations about the completeness of your data and validate these expectations against your datasets.

To use Great Expectations for data completeness, you can define expectations such as:

* The percentage of missing values in a column should be less than a certain threshold.
* The percentage of complete records in a dataset should be above a certain threshold.
* The percentage of complete columns in a dataset should be above a certain threshold.
* Each record in the dataset should contain all the required fields and information.
* Each column in the dataset should contain all the required values and information.
* The dataset should not contain any missing values.
* The dataset should not contain any duplicate records.

```python
import great_expectations as ge

# Load a dataset
df = ge.read_csv('data.csv')

# Define expectations for data completeness
expectation_suite = ge.ExpectationSuite('my_expectations')
expectation_suite.expect_column_values_to_not_be_null('column_name')
expectation_suite.expect_table_row_count_to_be_between(min_value=1000, max_value=2000)

# Validate the expectations against the dataset
results = df.validate(expectation_suite)

# Save the expectation suite
expectation_suite.save()

# Generate a data quality report
df.profile(expectation_suite)

# Visualize the results
results.visualize()

# Check the status of the validation
results.success

# Check the validation results
results.results

# Check the validation statistics
results.statistics

# Check the validation meta
results.meta
```

## Managing Performance and Scalability

When dealing with large datasets, assessing data completeness can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. To manage performance and scalability, consider the following strategies:

1. **Sampling**: Instead of assessing completeness on the entire dataset, sample a subset of the data to estimate completeness metrics. This can reduce the computational burden and provide a quick overview of data quality.
2. **Parallel Processing**: Use parallel processing techniques to distribute the workload across multiple processors or nodes. This can speed up the assessment of data completeness for large datasets.
3. **Incremental Assessment**: Instead of assessing completeness on the entire dataset at once, break down the assessment into smaller chunks and assess completeness incrementally. This can help manage memory usage and improve performance.
4. **Data Partitioning**: Partition the data into smaller chunks based on certain criteria (e.g., time, location, category) and assess completeness on each partition separately. This can improve performance and scalability by reducing the amount of data processed at once.
5. **Data Sampling and Profiling**: Use data sampling and profiling techniques to analyze the distribution of missing values and identify patterns of missingness. This can help optimize the assessment of data completeness and improve performance.
6. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Implement data quality monitoring tools and processes to continuously monitor data completeness metrics and detect anomalies or changes in data quality over time. This can help identify issues early and prevent data quality degradation.
7. **Automated Data Quality Checks**: Implement automated data quality checks using tools like Great Expectations to validate data completeness expectations automatically. This can streamline the assessment process and ensure consistent data quality standards.
8. **Data Quality Pipelines**: Build data quality pipelines that automate the assessment of data completeness and integrate it into your data processing workflows. This can help ensure that data completeness is assessed regularly and consistently as part of your data pipeline.
