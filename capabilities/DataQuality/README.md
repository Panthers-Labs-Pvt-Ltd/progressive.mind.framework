# Data Quality

Data quality is the process of ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and reliable. Data quality is important because it affects the accuracy of data analysis, decision-making, and business operations. Poor data quality can lead to incorrect conclusions, poor decisions, and wasted resources. Data quality is a critical component of data management and data governance.

## Data Quality Dimensions

Data quality can be measured using several dimensions, including:

### Accuracy

Please see [Data Accuracy](Data_Accuracy.md) for more information.

### Completeness

Please see [Data Completeness](Data_Completeness.md) for more information.

### Uniqueness

Please see [Data Uniqueness](Data_Uniqueness.md) for more information.

### Consistency

Please see [Data Consistency](Data_Consistency.md) for more information.

### Timeliness

Timeliness measures how up-to-date data is and how quickly it is available for analysis. Timely data is available when needed and is not outdated.

### Conformity

Conformity measures how well data conforms to the rules, standards, and constraints of its data model or schema. Conforming data is accurate, complete, and consistent with its data model.

### Integrity

Integrity measures how well data is protected from unauthorized access, modification, or corruption. Secure data is protected from security threats, breaches, and attacks.

### Validity

Validity measures how well data conforms to the rules, standards, and constraints of its data model or schema. Valid data is accurate, complete, and consistent with its data model.

### Relevance

Relevance measures how well data meets the needs of its users and stakeholders. Relevant data is useful, meaningful, and valuable for decision-making and analysis.

### Usability

Usability measures how easy it is to access, understand, and use data. Usable data is accessible, user-friendly, and well-documented.

### Trustworthiness

Trustworthiness measures how reliable, credible, and trustworthy data is. Trustworthy data is accurate, complete, consistent, and secure.

## Data Quality Metrics



## Measuring Consistency

Consistency can be measured by comparing data across different sources, systems, or time periods. Consistency can be measured using metrics such as discrepancy rate, conflict rate, and consistency score.

## Measuring Timeliness

Timeliness can be measured by assessing how quickly data is available for analysis or how up-to-date data is. Timeliness can be measured using metrics such as latency, freshness, and timeliness score.

## Measuring Conformity

Conformity can be measured by comparing data to the rules, standards, and constraints of its data model or schema. Conformity can be measured using metrics such as compliance rate, conformity rate, and conformity score.

## Measuring Integrity

Integrity can be measured by assessing how well data is protected from unauthorized access, modification, or corruption. Integrity can be measured using metrics such as security score, integrity score, and trust score.

## Measuring Validity

Validity can be measured by comparing data to the rules, standards, and constraints of its data model or schema. Validity can be measured using metrics such as validation rate, validity rate, and validity score.

## Measuring Relevance

Relevance can be measured by assessing how well data meets the needs of its users and stakeholders. Relevance can be measured using metrics such as relevance score, usefulness score, and value score.

## Measuring Usability

Usability can be measured by assessing how easy it is to access, understand, and use data. Usability can be measured using metrics such as accessibility score, user-friendliness score, and documentation score.

## Measuring Trustworthiness

Trustworthiness can be measured by assessing how reliable, credible, and trustworthy data is. Trustworthiness can be measured using metrics such as trust score, credibility score, and reliability score.
