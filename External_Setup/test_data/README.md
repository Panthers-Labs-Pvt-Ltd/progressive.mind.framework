# Set up

The following instructions will help you set up your test environment. The goal is to have a working environment that will allow you to run the tests and see the results.

## Project setup

1. The Setup would create a folder named "data" in the home directory of the user. 
2. All the external data sources will be housed in Kaggle. We have created a Kaggle account for the project. The credentials file would be saved in ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json. The setup will automatically this file along with Kaggle CLI.

## Mimicking external data sources

1. To download files from Kaggle, just run the command `. kaggle.sh download  <dataset-name>. This will download the dataset in ~/data/external folder.
