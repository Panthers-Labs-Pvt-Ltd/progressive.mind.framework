# Pipeline Creation Journey

## Introduction
This document outlines the steps involved in creating a data pipeline. The pipeline consists of three main stages: Extract, Transform, and Persist.

## Steps

### 1. Extract
The extract stage involves retrieving data from various sources. This can include databases, APIs, or flat files.

**Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Extract data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('data/source_data.csv')
```

### 2. Transform
The transform stage involves cleaning, filtering, and modifying the data to fit the desired format.

**Example:**
```python
# Remove null values
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Convert data types
data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])
```

### 3. Persist
The persist stage involves saving the transformed data to a storage system, such as a database or a data warehouse.

**Example:**
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create a database connection
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///data/transformed_data.db')

# Persist data to the database
data.to_sql('transformed_table', con=engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create a robust data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and persists data efficiently.
