# Data Integrity

There are three different interpretations of data integrity:

1. Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability/quality of data throughout its lifecycle. Data integrity can be measured using metrics such as data quality - data completeness, data consistency, and data reliability.
2. Data integrity refers to the protection and security of data to ensure that data is protected from unauthorized access, modification without authorization, or corruption. Data integrity can be measured using metrics such as data security, data privacy, data protection, and data encryption.
3. iceDQ defines Data integrity as the degree to which a defined relational constraint is implemented between two data sets. The most common constraint is the primary key-foreign key relationship, also called referential integrity, and cardinal integrity (ratio m:n relation between datasets).

## Use cases

1. Ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and reliability throughout the data lifecycle.
2. Protecting data from unauthorized access, modification, or corruption.
3. Implementing relational constraints between datasets to ensure data integrity.
4. Ensuring data quality, data security, data privacy, and data protection.
5. Ensuring data compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA.
6. Ensuring data consistency, data reliability, and data availability.
7. Ensuring data is free from errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies.
8. Ensuring data is unique, distinct, and reliable.

## How to implement data integrity?

To implement data integrity, you need to follow these steps:

1. Define the relational constraints: Define the relational constraints between datasets to ensure data integrity. The most common constraint is the primary key-foreign key relationship, also called referential integrity, and cardinal integrity (ratio m:n relation between datasets).
2. Implement the constraints: Implement the constraints in the database schema to enforce data integrity. Use database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle to define and enforce the constraints.
3. Validate the constraints: Validate the constraints by checking if the data conforms to the defined constraints. Use data quality tools such as Great Expectations, TensorFlow Data Validation, and AWS Deeque to automate the validation of data integrity.
4. Monitor data integrity: Monitor data integrity over time to ensure that data remains accurate, consistent, and reliable. Use data quality tools to monitor data integrity and identify issues or violations of the defined constraints.
5. Resolve integrity violations: Resolve integrity violations by identifying and fixing data inconsistencies, errors, or inaccuracies. Clean the data, preprocess the data, and prepare the data for analysis.
6. Implement data integrity checks: Implement data integrity checks, rules, or constraints to prevent data inconsistencies, errors, or inaccuracies. Use data quality tools to define and enforce data integrity checks.
7. Automate data integrity checks: Automate data integrity checks using data quality tools such as Great Expectations, TensorFlow Data Validation, and AWS Deeque to monitor data integrity over time.
8. Define data quality metrics: Define data quality metrics such as the percentage of conforming records, non-conforming records, and the percentage of conforming records in a dataset to assess data integrity.
9. Ensure data security and privacy: Ensure data security and privacy to protect data from unauthorized access, modification, or corruption. Use data security measures such as encryption, access controls, and data masking to secure data.
10. Ensure data compliance: Ensure data compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA to protect data privacy, data protection, and data security.
11. Ensure data reliability and availability: Ensure data reliability and availability to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and available when needed. Use data replication, backup, and disaster recovery measures to ensure data availability.
12. Ensure data quality: Ensure data quality by monitoring data completeness, data consistency, and data reliability. Use data quality tools to assess data quality and identify issues or violations of data integrity.
13. Ensure data uniqueness and distinctness: Ensure data uniqueness and distinctness by identifying and removing duplicates, redundancies, and inconsistencies in the data. Use data profiling tools to identify uniqueness issues and assess data quality.
14. Ensure data accuracy and consistency: Ensure data accuracy and consistency by comparing data across different sources, systems, or time periods. Use data consistency checks to identify inconsistencies, contradictions, or conflicts in the data.
15. Ensure data reliability and availability: Ensure data reliability and availability by monitoring data integrity, data security, and data privacy. Use data quality tools to assess data reliability and availability and identify issues or violations of data integrity.
16. Ensure data protection and security: Ensure data protection and security by implementing data security measures such as encryption, access controls, and data masking. Use data security tools to secure data and protect it from unauthorized access, modification, or corruption.

## Examples

```python
import great_expectations as ge

# Load a dataset
df = ge.read_csv('data.csv')

# Define expectations for data integrity
expectation_suite = ge.ExpectationSuite('my_expectations')
expectation_suite.expect_column_values_to_be_in_set('column_name', ['value1', 'value2', 'value3'])

# Validate the expectations against the dataset
results = df.validate(expectation_suite)

# Save the expectation suite
expectation_suite.save()

# Generate a data quality report
df.profile(expectation_suite)

# Visualize the results
results.visualize()

# Check the status of the validation
results.success

# Check the validation results
results.results
```

```python
import tensorflow_data_validation as tfdv

# Load a dataset
df = tfdv.load_csv('data.csv')

# Generate statistics for the dataset
stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(df)

# Infer the schema for the dataset
schema = tfdv.infer_schema(stats)

# Validate the dataset against the schema
anomalies = tfdv.validate_statistics(stats, schema)

# Fix the anomalies in the dataset
fixed_df = tfdv.fix_anomalies(df, schema, anomalies)

# Save the schema
tfdv.write_schema_text(schema, 'schema.pbtxt')

# Save the fixed dataset
fixed_df.to_csv('fixed_data.csv')
```

```scala
// Using AWS Deeque
import com.amazon.deequ.VerificationSuite

// Load a dataset
val df = spark.read.csv("data.csv")

// Define expectations for data integrity
val verificationResult = VerificationSuite()
  .onData(df)
  .addCheck(
    Check(CheckLevel.Error, "integrity check")
      .hasSize(_ >= 1000)
      .isComplete("column_name")
      .isUnique("column_name")
  )
  .run()

// Check the verification result
verificationResult.status

// Check the verification metrics
verificationResult.metrics

// Check the verification warnings
verificationResult.warnings

// Check the verification errors
verificationResult.errors
```
