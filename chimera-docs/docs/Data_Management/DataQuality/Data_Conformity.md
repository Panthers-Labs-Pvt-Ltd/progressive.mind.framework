# Data Conformity

Conformity measures how well data conforms to the rules, standards, and constraints of its data model or schema. This includes data following specific rules about its format, data type, and size. Consider, for example, "2024-12-18" conforms to "YYYY-MM-DD" format while "December 18th, 2024" does not. Conforming data is accurate, complete, and consistent with its data model.

Conformity can be measured using metrics such as the number of conforming records, the number of non-conforming records, and the percentage of conforming records in a dataset.

Conformity can be measured by comparing data to the rules, standards, and constraints of its data model or schema. Conformity can be measured using metrics such as compliance rate, conformity rate, and conformity score.

To ensure data conformity, we can use the following methods:

1. Define data model: Define a data model or schema that specifies the rules, standards, and constraints for the data. The data model should define the format, data type, size, and other properties of the data.
2. Validate data against the model: Validate the data against the data model to check if the data conforms to the rules, standards, and constraints specified in the model.
3. Identify non-conforming data: Identify non-conforming data that does not adhere to the rules, standards, and constraints of the data model. Non-conforming data may contain errors, inconsistencies, or inaccuracies.
4. Resolve non-conformities: Resolve non-conformities in the data by standardizing data formats, representations, or values. Clean the data, preprocess the data, and prepare the data for analysis.
5. Monitor data conformity: Monitor data conformity over time to ensure that data remains accurate, complete, and consistent with its data model.
6. Implement data conformity checks: Implement data conformity checks, rules, or constraints to prevent non-conformities in the data.
7. Automate data conformity checks: Automate data conformity checks using data quality tools such as Great Expectations, TensorFlow Data Validation, and AWS Deeque to monitor data conformity over time.
8. Define data quality metrics: Define data quality metrics such as the percentage of conforming records, non-conforming records, and the percentage of conforming records in a dataset to assess data conformity.

## Examples

```python
import great_expectations as ge

# Load a dataset
df = ge.read_csv('data.csv')

# Define expectations for data conformity
expectation_suite = ge.ExpectationSuite('my_expectations')
expectation_suite.expect_column_values_to_match_json_schema('column_name', 'schema.json')

# Validate the expectations against the dataset
results = df.validate(expectation_suite)

# Save the expectation suite
expectation_suite.save()

# Generate a data quality report
df.profile(expectation_suite)

# Visualize the results
results.visualize()

# Check the status of the validation
results.success

# Check the validation results
results.results
```

```python
import tensorflow_data_validation as tfdv

# Load a dataset
df = tfdv.load_csv('data.csv')

# Generate statistics for the dataset
stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(df)

# Infer the schema for the dataset
schema = tfdv.infer_schema(stats)

# Validate the dataset against the schema
anomalies = tfdv.validate_statistics(stats, schema)

# Fix the anomalies in the dataset
fixed_df = tfdv.fix_anomalies(df, schema, anomalies)

# Save the schema
tfdv.write_schema_text(schema, 'schema.pbtxt')

# Save the fixed dataset
fixed_df.to_csv('fixed_data.csv')
```

```scala
// Using AWS Deeque
import com.amazon.deequ.VerificationSuite

// Load a dataset
val verificationResult = VerificationSuite()
  .onData(data)
  .addCheck(
    Check(CheckLevel.Error, "Check data conformity")
      .isComplete("column_name")
      .isUnique("column_name")
      .isConformingTo("column_name", "constraint")
  )
  .run()

// Check the verification result
verificationResult.status

// Check the verification metrics
verificationResult.metrics

// Check the verification warnings
verificationResult.warnings

// Check the verification errors
verificationResult.errors

// Check the verification data
verificationResult.data

// Check the verification constraint results
verificationResult.constraintResults

// Check the verification constraint success metrics
verificationResult.constraintSuccessMetrics

// Check the verification constraint warnings
verificationResult.constraintWarnings

// Check the verification constraint errors
verificationResult.constraintErrors

// Check the verification constraint data
verificationResult.constraintData
```
