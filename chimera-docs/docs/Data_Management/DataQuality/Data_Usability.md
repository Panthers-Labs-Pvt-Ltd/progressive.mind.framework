# Data Usability

Usability measures how easy it is to access, understand, and use data. Usable data is accessible, user-friendly, and well-documented.

Data owners should also publish code to use, visualize, and analyze the data. This code should be well-documented, version-controlled, and tested.

Usability can be measured by assessing how easy it is to access, understand, and use data. Usability can be measured using metrics such as accessibility score, user-friendliness score, and documentation score.
