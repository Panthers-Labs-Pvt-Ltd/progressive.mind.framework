# Data Consistency

Consistency measures how well data is consistent across different sources, systems, and time periods. Consistent data is free from contradictions, discrepancies, and conflicts. Consistency can be measured using metrics such as discrepancy rate, conflict rate, and consistency score.

## Use cases

* Preventing record duplication or loss - Record level Data Consistency across source and target systems
* Preventing data corruption or leakage - Attribute level Data Consistency across source and target systems
* Preventing incorrect data reporting - Data Consistency between two subject areas
* Data Consistency across time periods - Reporting Data Spike or Dip across time periods
* Data Consistency across systems - Achieved via standardizing data formats and representations across systems

## How to implement data consistency?

To implement data consistency, you need to follow these steps:

1. Define the problem: Identify the data consistency issues you want to address and the data sources, systems, or time periods you want to compare.
2. Collect data: Collect the data you need to compare for consistency. Clean the data, preprocess the data, and prepare the data for analysis.
3. Compare data: Compare the data across different sources, systems, or time periods to identify inconsistencies, contradictions, or conflicts.
4. Resolve conflicts: Resolve conflicts, discrepancies, or contradictions in the data by standardizing data formats, representations, or values.
5. Monitor data consistency: Monitor data consistency over time to ensure that data remains consistent and accurate.
6. Implement data consistency checks: Implement data consistency checks, rules, or constraints to prevent data inconsistencies, contradictions, or conflicts.
7. Automate data consistency checks: Automate data consistency checks using data quality tools such as Great Expectations, TensorFlow Data Validation, and AWS Deeque to monitor data consistency over time.

## Examples

```python
import great_expectations as ge

# Load a dataset
df = ge.read_csv('data.csv')

# Define expectations for data consistency
expectation_suite = ge.ExpectationSuite('my_expectations')
expectation_suite.expect_column_values_to_be_in_set('column_name', ['value1', 'value2', 'value3'])

# Validate the expectations against the dataset
results = df.validate(expectation_suite)

# Save the expectation suite
expectation_suite.save()

# Generate a data quality report
df.profile(expectation_suite)

# Visualize the results
results.visualize()

# Check the status of the validation
results.success

# Check the validation results
results.results
```

```python
import tensorflow_data_validation as tfdv

# Load a dataset
df = tfdv.load_csv('data.csv')

# Generate statistics for the dataset
stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(df)

# Infer the schema for the dataset
schema = tfdv.infer_schema(stats)

# Validate the dataset against the schema
anomalies = tfdv.validate_statistics(stats, schema)

# Fix the anomalies in the dataset
fixed_df = tfdv.fix_anomalies(df, schema, anomalies)

# Save the schema
tfdv.write_schema_text(schema, 'schema.pbtxt')

# Save the fixed dataset
fixed_df.to_csv('fixed_data.csv')
```

```scala
// Using AWS Deeque
import com.amazon.deequ.VerificationSuite

// Load a dataset
val df = spark.read.csv("data.csv")

// Define expectations for data consistency
val verificationResult = VerificationSuite()
  .onData(df)
  .addCheck(
    check = check(CheckLevel.Error, "Check data consistency")
      .hasSize(_ >= 1000)
      .isComplete("column_name")
      .isUnique("column_name")
  )
  .run()

// Generate a data quality report
verificationResult.successMetricsAsDataFrame.show()

// Visualize the results
verificationResult.status

// Check the validation results
verificationResult.checkResults

// Check the validation statistics
verificationResult.metricMap

// Check the validation meta
verificationResult.status
```
