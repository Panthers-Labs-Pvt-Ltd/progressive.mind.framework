# Data Validity

Validity measures how well data conforms to the rules, standards, and constraints of its data model or schema. Valid data is accurate, complete, and consistent with its data model.

Data validity describes the closeness of data value to predetermined values or a calculation.


Validity can be measured by comparing data to the rules, standards, and constraints of its data model or schema. Validity can be measured using metrics such as validation rate, validity rate, and validity score.


Data validity simply means how well does data meet certain criteria, often evolving from analysis of prior data as relationships and issues are revealed.

Data teams can develop data validity rules or data validation tests after profiling the data and seeing where it breaks. These rules might include:

Valid values in a column
Column conforms to a specific format
Primary key integrity
Nulls in a column
Valid value combination
Computational rules
Chronological rules
Conditional rules
