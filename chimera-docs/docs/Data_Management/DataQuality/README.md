# Data Quality

Data quality is the process of ensuring that data is accurate, complete, and reliable. Data quality is important because it affects the accuracy of data analysis, decision-making, and business operations. Poor data quality can lead to incorrect conclusions, poor decisions, and wasted resources. Data quality is a critical component of data management and data governance.

This module provides two distinct approaches to data quality:

1. Coarse Data Quality (in a pipeline): This approach focuses on data quality checks in a data pipeline. This approach is required to ensure that Chimera supports quicker execution of pipeline. It is also based on assumption that most of the time, data is of good quality and only few checks are required to ensure that data is of good quality, and if it is not, it would be caught in full-fledged data quality assessment. **Please note if coarse data is failing, it must be fail and stop the pipeline.**
2. Detailed Data Quality (in batch): This approach focuses on full-fledged data quality assessment. This approach is required to ensure that all the data quality issues are tracked and monitored. **Please note if Detailed DQ is failing, it must be logged into Data Issue Register if it breaches various thresholds.**

## Data Quality Tools

Data quality tools are software applications that help organizations monitor, measure, and improve the quality of their data. Data quality tools automate data profiling, data cleansing, data validation, data enrichment, and data monitoring tasks. Data quality tools help organizations identify data quality issues, resolve data quality problems, and prevent data quality errors.

Data quality tools include:

- Data monitoring tools to detect change in data to trigger data quality workflow
- Data quality workflows to retrieve data, profile data, validate data, and save data quality results
- UI or some mechanism to set up Data quality rules and alerts
- Data quality notifications
- Data quality APIs - Do we need this explicitly or should it be done via Observability UI and Datahub?
- Data quality integration with Datahub and Data Observability UI
- Data quality metrics and reports dashboards (maybe in Data Observability UI)
- Data cleansing tools - Optional

## Data Quality Best Practices

Data quality best practices are guidelines, principles, and recommendations for improving the quality of data. Data quality best practices help organizations establish data quality standards, policies, and procedures. Data quality best practices help organizations ensure that data is accurate, complete, conformed, consistent, relevant, timely, valid, secure, usable, and trustworthy.

Data quality best practices include:

- Data quality assessment
