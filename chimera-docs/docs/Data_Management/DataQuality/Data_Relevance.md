# Data Relevance

Relevance measures how well data meets the needs of its users and stakeholders. Relevant data is useful, meaningful, and valuable for decision-making and analysis.

Relevance can be measured by assessing how well data meets the needs of its users and stakeholders. Relevance can be measured using metrics such as relevance, or usefulness or, value score.

I really do not understand how to do this yet. A story https://progressivemindsaiml.atlassian.net/browse/AIML-25 has been created to define and implement this.

## Implementation Guidance

1. **Understand the Needs of Data Users and Stakeholders**: Identify the needs of data users and stakeholders. This can be done through interviews, surveys, or other methods. Understanding the needs of data users and stakeholders will help you determine what data is relevant to them.
2. **Define Metrics for Data Relevance**: Define metrics for data relevance. Metrics can include relevance, usefulness, or value score. These metrics will help you measure how well data meets the needs of its users and stakeholders.
3. **Collect Data**: Collect data on the defined metrics. This can be done through surveys, interviews, or other methods.
4. **Analyze Data**: Analyze the data collected to determine how well data meets the needs of its users and stakeholders. This can be done by calculating relevance, usefulness, or value score.
5. **Take Action**: Take action based on the results of the analysis. If data is not relevant to its users and stakeholders, take steps to improve its relevance.
6. **Monitor and Improve**: Monitor data relevance over time and take steps to improve it. This can be done by collecting feedback from data users and stakeholders and making changes based on their feedback.
7. **Communicate Results**: Communicate the results of the analysis to data users and stakeholders. This will help them understand how well data meets their needs and how it can be improved.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Step 1: Define the problem
user_needs = "Identify key insights and trends in sales data"

# Step 2: Collect data
data = {
    'document': [
        "Sales increased by 20% in Q1",
        "Customer satisfaction improved by 15%",
        "New product launch was successful",
        "Revenue growth in Q2 was 10%"
    ]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 3: Analyze data
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['document'])
user_needs_vector = vectorizer.transform([user_needs])

# Step 4: Create usefulness score
usefulness_scores = cosine_similarity(user_needs_vector, tfidf_matrix).flatten()

# Add usefulness scores to the DataFrame
df['usefulness_score'] = usefulness_scores

# Step 5: Communicate results
print(df)

```
