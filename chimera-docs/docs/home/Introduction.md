### Challenges in Current Data and AI Platforms

Today's Data and AI platforms often face significant challenges that can hinder their effectiveness and value creation. Some of these challenges include:

- **Broken Linkage between Data and AIOps**: Many platforms struggle to seamlessly integrate data operations (DataOps) with AI operations (AIOps), leading to inefficiencies and fragmented workflows.
- **Missing SRE Capability**: The lack of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) capabilities results in suboptimal system performance and reliability, making it difficult to ensure consistent service levels.
- **Inadequate Data Management**: Comprehensive data management is often missing, leading to issues with data quality, governance, and lineage. This can result in inaccurate insights and non-compliance with regulatory standards.
- **Scalability Issues**: As data volumes grow, many platforms struggle to scale efficiently, resulting in performance bottlenecks and increased operational costs.
- **Security and Compliance Gaps**: Ensuring data security and compliance with industry regulations is a persistent challenge, leading to potential data breaches and legal liabilities.
- **Lack of Real-time Insights**: Without robust real-time data processing and visualization capabilities, organizations may miss out on critical insights that can drive timely and informed decision-making.

Before we get into any other service description, it is important to realize that all the Chimera services would API as base to interact with each other. Chimera API service is the core service that provides the RESTful API endpoints for all the Chimera services. The API service is responsible for handling user requests, authentication, authorization, and routing requests to the appropriate service. It also provides documentation for the API endpoints and allows users to interact with the platform programmatically.

You can find more details in the [API_Service.md](../API_Service.md) document.

Before going to on Data Ingestion, Processing, Storage, and other services, we need to understand the Orchestration Services. Some of the popular orchestration frameworks are [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/), and [Dagstar](https://dagster.io/). Customers can choose to use any of these orchestrators - all the other Chimera services would work just fine with minor configuration updates. We however, use [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) as default. The reason we chose Temporal is because of its architecture to manage failures, network outages, flaky endpoints, long-running processes and more, ensuring that Chimera workflows or pipeline never fail.
